Steps to run the criterias:
    1/ Go to the folder ./test_folder
    2/ Launch the file corresponding to the criteria
    you want : python <name_of_file>
    For each file there are :
        - 1 passed test (with a control graph and a dataset)
        - 1 failed test (with a control graph and a dataset)
        - 1 generation of dataset for the criteria (only for criterias 
        1,2,3 and 8)
